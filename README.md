# ASP-Database
ASP.NET and SQL Database system
This project contains a system, that allows users to view, add, delete and edit data on a website. 
Currently this website is not hosted anywhere, because my main website banaanigames.com is hosted with GitHub pages, which does not have the capability of hosting ASP.NET based projects.
Also currently (15.9.2023) the database itself is just hosted locally.

I have many ideas for continuation of this project, like a proper host and a SQL database server.
I am planning to use this project later on for hosting data for my game projects.

A lot of the content in this project are from the basic ASP.NET template or needed for basic functionality.
To see "the real proper content", check the files under ASP & Database -> Pages -> Test. (No, that will not be the final folder name :D )
